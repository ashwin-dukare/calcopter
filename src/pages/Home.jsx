    About the Calculators
  </h2>
  <p className="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
    These tools are designed to help drone builders, pilots, and engineers estimate the endurance of multicopters with precision. Whether you're working on a DIY drone, professional aerial platform, or agricultural multicopter, these calculators let you simulate real-world flight times.
  </p>
  <p className="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg mt-4 leading-relaxed">
    Each calculator serves a different use caseâ€”based on what information you currently have. Battery-based for power data, MTOW-based for complete build estimation, and motor-based for custom setups. Use the one that fits your scenario and plan your builds with confidence.
